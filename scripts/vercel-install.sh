# vendor/ is not committed — it is 2MB of tarballs that change on
# every engine iteration — so a fresh clone has no engine to build
# against. Locally `vendor-gesso.sh` packs one out of ../gesso; here
# there is no ../gesso, so this fetches the exact commit the last
# vendoring packed from, recorded in gesso.lock, and hands it to the
# same script. The deployed build therefore runs the engine the
# working copy ran, and not whatever is on Gesso's main branch.

# vendor-gesso.sh builds the packages, packs them under content
# hashes, rewrites package.json and pnpm-workspace.yaml to match, and
# installs. The rewrite is what the lockfile cannot survive: the
# hashes are a property of the bytes just built, so the committed
# lockfile names tarballs that no longer exist and pnpm, which will
# not move a lockfile under CI, stops with
# ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH on the `overrides` block.
#
# It has to be this flag and not NPM_CONFIG_FROZEN_LOCKFILE, which
# pnpm ignores. The env var read as a suggestion is why the first
# deploy failed and the second — packing, by luck, to the same hashes
# the lockfile already named — did not.
