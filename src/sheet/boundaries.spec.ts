/**
 * The seam, as a spec rather than as a promise in a comment.
 *
 * Phase 1's constraint is that the sheet model is plain TypeScript: no
 * framework, no RxJS, no browser. That is what lets these specs run in
 * node in milliseconds, and it is what will let Phase 2 put the model
 * behind a channel without the model noticing.
 *
 * It is also the kind of rule that decays silently. One `import type`
 * for convenience is harmless, and the one after it drags a runtime
 * import in behind it, and by then the model only runs in a worker and
 * nobody can say which change did it. So it is checked: a dependency
 * that is not a relative path inside this directory fails the build,
 * with the file and the import named.
